# Numerical Finance 2024/2025 - Pricing of Bermudan basket options
Blanchard Faune and Magerand Alban, within the scope of the <code>M203 Numerical finance class</code>. \
In this project, we dig into the pricing of both European and Bermudean calls on basket options. \
We implement the following variance reduction techniques: 
- Antithetic variable
- Static control variate
- Quasi-MC, using Kakutani sequences
To obtain the results we present in the report, please see the file: <code>Test/Files_Report_Generation.cpp</code>
